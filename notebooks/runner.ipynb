      "Researcher: Hi, thanks for joining me today. To start, could you walk me through your current approach or algorithm for managing a COPD patient who continues to have exacerbations despite being on optimized dual or triple inhaled therapy?\n",
      "User: Sure, so this comes up a lot. If someone’s been on, say, LAMA/LABA/ICS and is still flaring, my first instinct is to double-check everything before switching meds: are they actually using their inhalers correctly? Do they even have them, with insurance lapses and all? I’ll pull in pharmacy or our nurse educator to do a check-in, sometimes even have them bring inhalers to clinic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once I know adherence and technique aren’t the main issues, I’ll look for other triggers—sleep apnea, heart failure, reflux, new exposures at home or work. Our population here, a lot of folks are dealing with complicated housing or secondhand smoke, so social work and case management get involved pretty fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we’ve ruled out those factors and they’re still getting hospitalized or needing steroids, I’ll consider eosinophils but honestly, our patients’ labs are all over the place. For high eos, I might try roflumilast, but it causes GI side effects and isn’t always covered. Macrolides for some, if they’re not at high risk for resistance or cardiac stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "But honestly, a lot of my “algorithm” is dictated by what’s feasible for the patient—can they even get to pulmonary rehab, do they have transportation, do they understand their action plan? I end up calling community health workers for home visits or checking if they’re eligible for remote monitoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, it’s definitely not as clean as an algorithm on paper. It’s more about troubleshooting barriers, layering on supports, and occasionally trialing other meds if it’s safe and covered. Sometimes, despite best efforts, we just do our best to keep folks stable where we can.\n",
      "Researcher: That's really helpful context, thank you. You mentioned considering eosinophils—can you tell me more about what specific clinical clues or patient features make you start suspecting a type 2 or eosinophilic phenotype in your COPD patients?\n",
      "User: Sure, I can talk through that. I don’t have a single “aha” moment for eosinophilic COPD, but there are some signs that get me thinking about it. If a patient has frequent “asthma-like” exacerbations—wheezing that responds to steroids, more bronchodilator reversibility than I expect, maybe a personal or family history of asthma or allergies—that pushes me to check their eosinophil counts a few times, not just once.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll look back through their labs; if I see peripheral eosinophils consistently above 300, or even trending up over several visits, I start to wonder. But in reality, our patients’ counts jump around—one patient had eos 500 during a flare, then 120 a month later, so I rarely base big decisions on a single draw.\n",
      "\n",
      "If someone’s flaring despite what should be enough inhaled steroid, especially when they have those “allergic” triggers—pets, seasonal symptoms—I’m more likely to consider them for roflumilast or, if we had access, biologics (which we mostly don’t yet). I also pay attention to how much they improve with prednisone; if they have big, dramatic responses, that’s another clue.\n",
      "\n",
      "But honestly, phenotype is part of the puzzle, not the whole story. Insurance, patient preference, and comorbidities steer a lot of what we can actually try in real life.\n",
      "Researcher: That's interesting about how you look for patterns over time rather than relying on a single eosinophil count. You mentioned considering roflumilast and, if available, biologics. Can you walk me through where therapies like roflumilast, chronic macrolide therapy, mucolytics, pulmonary rehab, bronchoscopic interventions, and now dupilumab would fit into your treatment flow for these patients?\n",
      "User: Sure, happy to break that down as it plays out in our clinic. It’s definitely not stepwise like the guidelines make it look—every patient’s needs, insurance, and level of buy-in are different.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roflumilast: I usually think of this for folks with frequent flares and chronic bronchitis symptoms, especially if they have higher eos or can’t tolerate stepping up steroids. But GI side effects are a huge barrier. I’d say maybe only 1 in 4 of my patients who try it actually stay on it—nausea, weight loss, diarrhea, all pretty common complaints. Plus, Medicaid and some private plans push back hard—prior auth, hoops to jump through. I’ll still offer it if nothing else is working, but I set expectations pretty low.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chronic macrolide: I reach for azithro in ex-smokers or never-smokers with a lot of exacerbations, as long as they’re not at high cardiac risk and don’t have a ton of other antibiotics on board. We do baseline EKGs for QT, and I check about hearing loss. We run into resistance concerns, especially for folks with a lot of prior pneumonia or who live with young kids. But some patients love it—it really cuts down the flares for that select group.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mucolytics: N-acetylcysteine isn’t covered here, so honestly, I rarely use it. Occasionally someone will try guaifenesin OTC if they’re desperate, but I don’t see dramatic effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pulmonary rehab: I’d refer every single patient if I could. The catch is access—our urban center has long waitlists, and transportation is a nightmare for folks without steady housing or car access. If someone’s motivated and can get there, it’s gold. We do community outreach too, but it’s a drop in the bucket compared to need.\n",

      "Bronchoscopic interventions: We’re an academic center so we have access to valves and coils, but I’ve only had a couple of patients actually go through with it; most don’t meet the lung volume criteria, or there are comorbidities, or the insurance hurdles. Patients are often wary of anything invasive unless they’re desperate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dupilumab/biologics: Not part of routine care yet—biggest barrier is insurance and lack of clear-cut indications for non-asthma patients. I have maybe one patient in a year who actually got it\n",
      "Researcher: I hear you saying that dupilumab and other biologics aren’t yet a routine part of your practice, mainly due to insurance and indication barriers. With the recent updates to the GOLD follow-up algorithm for 2025, has that influenced your mental model or sequencing of these therapies at all?\n",
      "User: Honestly, not much so far. Most of the new GOLD stuff looks good on paper, but in the trenches, access hasn’t caught up—insurance isn’t saying yes just because GOLD says so. Dupilumab is still “not on formulary” for our COPD patients unless they have a slam-dunk asthma history, and even then it’s a slog with prior auths. \n",
      "\n",
      "The updated algorithm makes it easier to justify trying a biologic in theory, but my actual workflow hasn’t changed. I still run through the usual: optimize inhalers, check technique, try roflumilast if they tolerate it, macrolides for the right folks. Pulm rehab always if we can make it happen. Biologics come up in our team meetings, but until coverage opens up, it’s more of a future option than something I can routinely offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Patients are reading about these new meds too, so there’s a little more interest and expectation—but I have to keep circling back to “here’s what your insurance will actually cover.” In reality, most of my COPD patients who’d qualify under GOLD are still stuck with the inhaler/roflumilast/macrolide toolbox for now.\n",
      "Researcher: Thanks for sharing how the guidelines and real-world access sometimes diverge. Shifting to dupilumab specifically—where do you see it fitting into your step-up path for COPD patients today, and what alternatives would you consider if not dupilumab?\n",
      "User: Right now, for my COPD population, dupilumab mostly comes up as a theoretical “what if”—not a real part of my step-up options, simply because I almost never get it approved. If someone’s had multiple exacerbations despite max inhaled therapy—triple inhaler, all the technique checks, addressed adherence, plus we’ve run through roflumilast and maybe given azithro a shot—then maybe I’ll think about biologics. But honestly, I’ve only been able to get it for one patient, and that was a true overlap with severe asthma.\n",
      "\n",
      "So in practice, if someone’s still flaring with all that, I circle back and look for missed factors—was there an undiagnosed bronchiectasis? Is heart failure out of control? Is social situation sabotaging adherence (unstable housing, literacy issues)? Sometimes I’ll double down on pulmonary rehab or even arrange for visiting nurse check-ins, because those help more than “adding another med” for a lot of my folks.\n",
      "\n",
      "If dupilumab’s off the table, I revisit macrolides—some people can’t tolerate, but others do fine—and try to optimize everything else around them. Otherwise, we’re looking at symptom management, palliative approaches, and making sure we’re not missing something reversible. There’s just not much room to “step up” on paper if the system won’t pay for it. I spend a lot of time explaining to families why we can’t just “try the new shot” they saw on TV, which is honestly exhausting.\n",
      "Researcher: That's a really helpful perspective on the practical barriers. Thinking about your patients, are there certain archetypes or types of COPD patients who you feel would be a particularly good fit for dupilumab if access weren’t an issue? And are there others who feel more borderline or 'not yet' for this therapy?\n",
      "User: There are a few folks who come to mind right away who’d probably benefit if the barriers weren’t so high. One group is my patients who are younger—50s or early 60s—not your classic “end-stage” COPD but already racking up two, three exacerbations a year even on triple inhaler therapy. These are the people where it feels like we’re just waiting for the next admission, and they’re still motivated, maybe even still working. Especially if they have a lot of eosinophils—like, over 300—and no clear asthma history but maybe a little overlap. It’s frustrating because I feel like that’s exactly who’d get the most out of something new, but they’re the hardest to convince insurance to cover.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other group that sticks out are folks with bad steroid side effects: uncontrolled diabetes, osteoporosis, those who just can’t tolerate another burst. If dupilumab could help me keep them off steroids, I’d be all in.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the flipside, I probably wouldn’t rush to it for the very frail, advanced folks—bedbound, frequent hospitalizations, where the issue is as much social/environmental as biology. Same for people who can’t reliably make clinic visits, or who struggle with adherence to everything already—I’m skeptical we’d see benefit, and I’d worry about them missing doses or follow-up. Also, patients who are doing okay with their current regimen, even if they’re not perfect—it feels like too much to add another layer unless we’ve truly exhausted our simpler options.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess the bottom line is, I see the most potential in the “in-betweeners”—not mild, not end-stage, still some functional reserve, high exacerbation risk, and either high eos or steroid-intolerant. But again, it’s all theoretical until access changes.\n",
      "Researcher: That's a great breakdown of who might benefit most. If you were able to start someone on dupilumab, what would you look for in the first 3 to 6 months to feel confident that you made the right choice for that patient?\n",
      "User: Biggest thing for me would be a real drop in exacerbations—so, no ER visits, no steroid bursts, honestly even just one fewer flare would be noticeable with my crowd. I’d also pay close attention to how they’re feeling: are they breathing easier, able to do more, maybe get through their day with less shortness of breath? Sometimes the numbers don’t budge, but patients will tell you if they can walk their dog again or go grocery shopping without stopping five times.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’d want to see if their rescue inhaler use drops—one guy I have uses his albuterol nearly every day, so if that ticks down, that’s a win. I’d look at spirometry, but honestly, I care more about exacerbations and quality of life in this phase. I also ask about side effects every visit—especially with something new like this. Rash, eye issues, anything weird.\n",
      "\n",
      "If nothing’s improving in three to six months—still getting hospitalized, still needing steroids, no better daily function—I’d have a serious talk about whether it’s worth the hassle and cost to keep going. I try to set that expectation up front, so they know it’s a trial, not a forever commitment if there’s no payoff.\n",
      "Researcher: You mentioned earlier that labeling nuances—like the definition of eosinophilic phenotype or coexisting asthma—can shape your use of dupilumab. Are there any specific concerns or uncertainties about the labeling that influence your willingness to prescribe it?\n",
      "User: Definitely. The wording around “eosinophilic phenotype” is fuzzy in practice. I can’t always draw a clean line between high-eos COPD and somebody who’s got a little “smoldering” asthma history, or maybe just allergies—especially in my population, where records are sometimes spotty or diagnoses are made by whoever saw them last. So, when insurers or even our own specialty pharmacy push back and want “proof” it’s not asthma, or that it’s “just COPD with high eosinophils,” it gets tricky.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other thing: How high do eosinophils have to be? Our lab flags anything over 300, but some protocols talk about 150, some 300, some want it documented twice. I’ve had prior auths kicked back for not having the right value at the right time—even if the patient clearly fits the spirit of the indication.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then there’s the overlap question. Let’s say a patient has had wheezing since childhood, but no formal asthma diagnosis—just “reactive airways.” Are they in or out? Or if a patient has fixed obstruction but their PCP once labeled it “asthma/COPD overlap,” I never know how that’ll play out with insurance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Makes me hesitate to even start the process in borderline cases because of the paperwork hassle and the risk of wasting everyone’s time. If labeling was just “COPD with eosinophilia, regardless of prior asthma,” or if there was clearer guidance, I’d probably try it more often. Right now, the gray area is a real barrier.\n",
      "Researcher: Thanks for explaining those challenges with labeling and insurance. Shifting gears a bit, can you tell me about how, when, and how often you typically order blood eosinophil counts for your COPD patients? For example, do you check at baseline, during stability, or during/after an exacerbation?\n",
      "User: I usually get a baseline eosinophil count on anyone with moderate to severe COPD—so, if they’re moving beyond rescue inhaler territory or I’m considering adding an ICS or biologic. I try to check it when they’re stable, because if they’re in the ER or just had steroids, those numbers are junk. \n",
      "\n",
      "But honestly, a lot of my patients only get labs when they happen to be at a hospital visit, or if they’re seeing their PCP for something else. Sometimes, I’m just scrounging through the EMR for an old CBC to get a ballpark—sometimes from a year or two ago, which isn’t ideal, but it’s what I’ve got.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I’m planning to start something that hinges on the eosinophil count, like dupilumab or even sometimes ICS, I’ll try to get a fresh draw. But there are practical issues: getting folks to the lab, transportation, insurance not wanting to pay for “extra” labs if it’s not bundled with something else. So, in real life, it’s not nearly as systematic as I’d like. I don’t repeat counts routinely unless there’s a big treatment decision on the line, or if the insurer specifically demands it. Otherwise, if I have one decent value in the chart and the clinical picture fits, I’ll go with that.\n",
      "Researcher: That's helpful to hear about your approach. When you do get a blood eosinophil count, how do you interpret the results? Are there certain thresholds—like 150 or 300 cells per microliter—that trigger you to take action, and do you require repeat draws to confirm a high value?\n",
      "User: I’m usually looking for at least 150 to consider ICS, and 300 or above if I’m thinking about biologics or arguing the case with insurance. But I don’t treat these numbers as gospel. I know eosinophils can bounce around, especially if someone’s had steroids or has an infection. If I see a borderline value—say, 140 or 160—I’ll try to repeat it when they’re stable, but honestly, that’s easier said than done. With my patient population, just getting them back for a follow-up, or convincing them to do another blood draw, can be a whole ordeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I have a value in the 250+ range and the patient’s never had recent steroids, I feel pretty comfortable using that, even if it’s just one count. If I’m really on the fence or insurance is going to be picky, I might push for a repeat, but sometimes you just submit what you have and see if they’ll approve it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m also looking at the whole context—like, do they have a history of allergies, nasal polyps, or symptoms that make me think there’s an eosinophilic component? But, bottom line, there’s no perfect threshold in actual practice, and a lot depends on outside factors like payer rules and what I can realistically get from the patient.\n",
      "Researcher: That's interesting about how you weigh both the numbers and the broader clinical context. When you look at the eosinophil count, do you focus more on the absolute value, the percentage, or do you track trends over time? How do those factors influence your decisions?\n",
      "User: For me, it’s almost always the absolute value—I go by the cells per microliter, since that’s what the guidelines and insurances seem to care about, and it’s what’s bolded in our EMR. I honestly don’t look at the percentage unless the absolute isn’t reported, which is rare these days. Trends would be nice, but most of my folks don’t get labs regularly enough for trends to really mean much. I’m usually just working with whatever single value I can get.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I see a random blip—like one high count in a sea of lows—I’m cautious, especially if there’s a reason it could be artificially high or low (infection, steroids, whatever). But if someone’s generally running higher, or I have two separate counts both over 150 or 300, I feel more confident. But really, most of the time I have just one recent number, and that’s what I have to use.\n",
      "Researcher: You mentioned earlier that you sometimes look at the broader clinical picture, but do you ever use other biomarkers—like FeNO, IgE, or sputum eosinophils—in your COPD patients? Why or why not?\n",
      "User: No, I almost never use FeNO or sputum eos in my COPD folks. IgE I might check if I’m really thinking about overlap with asthma, but not routinely. FeNO isn’t available in our clinic, and even if it was, insurance doesn’t cover it for COPD in Nebraska, last I checked. Sputum eos is honestly just not practical—we don’t have the setup and patients aren’t usually keen on it anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mostly, I stick to basics: eosinophils from CBC, clinical history, and how they respond to therapy. If someone’s got a complicated allergy history or asthma-COPD overlap, sure, IgE might come into play, but that’s the exception. For my typical COPD patients, none of these fancy biomarkers are part of my real decision-making. Just doesn’t fit the way we practice or what patients are willing/able to do.\n",
      "Researcher: Thanks for sharing your approach to biomarkers. Thinking about the operational side, do you have on-site labs for eosinophil testing, or do you need to send samples out? How does turnaround time work in your setting?\n",
      "User: Yeah, we have on-site labs, so if a patient is here for a visit, I can usually get a CBC drawn right away—if they’re up for it. Results are typically back same day, sometimes even before the patient leaves if it’s a slow morning. But it’s not always smooth; if things are busy or the patient’s running late, sometimes labs get pushed to after the visit, and then I’m following up by phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "For folks coming from farther out or with transportation challenges, it can get frustrating. Some can’t get labs done here at all and have to use an outside facility, which means I might not see their results for a couple of days, or sometimes not at all if there’s a mix-up. So, while in theory I can get CBCs quickly, in real life there’s a lot of variability, and I often end up making decisions with whatever labs I have available, even if they’re a couple months old.\n",
      "Researcher: That's helpful to know about your lab setup. Do you use any EHR order sets, prompts, or smart phrases to help with ordering or tracking eosinophil counts for your COPD patients? Are there any decision support tools you wish you had?\n",
      "User: Yeah, our EHR (Epic) has basic order sets, but nothing COPD-specific for eosinophils—just the usual CBC panel. No prompts reminding me to check eos, either. I’ve made my own smartphrase to pull up recent CBCs, but to be honest, I mostly rely on memory and habit. If someone’s had an exacerbation or I’m thinking about stepping up inhaled steroids, I’ll look up the most recent CBC manually. There’s no built-in alert if it’s missing or outdated.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’d love some kind of flag or dashboard that shows the last eos count and how old it is—especially before I see the patient. It’s easy to lose track, especially with folks who bounce between clinics or get hospitalized at outside hospitals. Right now it’s a lot of clicking and digging, and things can fall through the cracks if the day gets chaotic.\n",
      "Researcher: Who on your team typically orders and follows up on eosinophil counts for COPD patients? Is it mostly you, or do nurses, pharmacists, or even PCPs play a role?\n",
      "User: It’s mostly on me, honestly. Nurses will draw the labs, but ordering and following up is pretty much my responsibility unless it’s an inpatient case—then sometimes residents or the hospitalist team will order it as part of admission workup. Pharmacists are great for med reconciliation, but they’re not usually tracking labs like eosinophils specifically. PCPs will sometimes order CBCs for annual labs, but unless they flag something for me, I don’t always see those results unless I go looking.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve tried looped messages in the EHR to coordinate, but with the volume of messages and turnover, it’s easy for stuff to get missed unless I’m proactive. In theory, it’d be great to have more shared responsibility, but in practice, it’s pretty siloed.\n",
      "Researcher: If you get a borderline eosinophil count—say, between 200 and 299, or if the values fluctuate from visit to visit—how do you handle that? Do you have a confirmatory process before considering a biologic?\n",
      "User: It depends who the patient is and what their history looks like. If I see an eosinophil count hovering in that 200-299 range, especially if it’s a single value, I don’t jump to action right away. I’ll check how recent it is—sometimes it’s six months old, sometimes just last week. If it was drawn during or right after an exacerbation or steroid burst, I usually want a repeat when things are more stable.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the values are bouncing around from one visit to the next, I usually look for a trend over time. I’ll sometimes ask for a repeat CBC at the next visit, especially if we’re talking about escalating to inhaled steroids or considering a biologic. I don’t have a strict “two out of three” rule or anything formal, but I do want to see some consistency, especially since insurance will ask for supporting labs if I try to prescribe a biologic.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are times when I’ll discuss it with colleagues—last fall I had a patient with really variable counts (like, 180 on one draw, 320 a few months later, then back to 210), and I brought it up at our weekly case conference. The consensus was to repeat it while off steroids and see what the “real” number was, since the patient was having frequent exacerbations but unclear benefit from previous steroid tapers.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, in short: it’s not black-and-white, and I have to balance what the guidelines say with what’s actually showing up in the chart and the patient’s story. Confirmatory process is more “clinical gut plus a second CBC” than anything standardized.\n",
      "Researcher: That's a thoughtful approach. Shifting gears a bit, when you think about starting dupilumab versus escalating or continuing inhaled strategies for a patient with recurrent exacerbations and elevated eosinophils, what benefits do you expect from dupilumab—such as reducing exacerbations, sparing oral steroids, improving lung function, or impacting quality of life?\n",
      "User: For me, dupilumab is mostly about reducing exacerbations and (hopefully) getting patients off the steroid rollercoaster. I see a lot of folks who are tired of prednisone bursts—either their PCP or the urgent care keeps giving them another dose, and they start complaining about insomnia, weight gain, blood sugars all over the place. If dupilumab can cut down those events, that’s a big win for both the patient and for us, since every exacerbation seems to set people back months in their baseline function and confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Steroid-sparing is another big thing I look for. I have a few patients—middle-aged farm workers and also a couple of retired bus drivers—who’ve just gotten rounder and more brittle from years of “rescue” steroids. If I can show we’re reducing that exposure, I count that as a success, even if their lung function numbers aren’t dramatically different.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lung function: honestly, I rarely see dramatic jumps in FEV1 in my clinic; maybe a little bump, but it’s more about stability. I tell patients, “My goal isn’t necessarily to make your numbers perfect, but to keep you from needing the ER or another round of steroids.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Quality of life is probably the biggest day-to-day change I hear about. People report fewer nights waking up coughing, or they aren’t as scared to leave the house. I had a patient last winter who was finally able to start babysitting her grandkids again because she wasn’t worried about a flare-up every week.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, in summary: fewer exacerbations, less steroid use, and letting people feel like their life isn’t totally on hold because of their breathing. Those are the wins I’m looking for with dupilumab, more than just numbers on a spirometry printout.\n",
      "Researcher: That's really clear about your priorities. Are there any risks or trade-offs that give you pause when considering dupilumab—such as safety concerns, pneumonia risk, the burden of injections, or uncertainties about long-term outcomes?\n",
      "User: There are a few things that make me pause, definitely. Injection burden is a big one for my population—some folks already struggle to get to appointments or pick up their meds, so asking them to keep up with every-other-week injections (plus the logistics of teaching self-injection or arranging visits) can be a real barrier. I've had a couple patients who just flat-out said, “Nope, I’m not adding another thing to my list.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Cost and insurance hurdles are another issue. It’s not just the prior auth—sometimes, even after approval, the copay is out of reach. We work with pharmacy and social work, but those conversations aren’t quick, and sometimes it still doesn’t pan out.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of safety, I haven’t personally seen any major red flags with dupilumab—no big issues with infections or eye problems in my own panel, but I know conjunctivitis and some rare reactions can happen. I do keep an eye out. I’ll also admit, I’m not always sure about the long-term effects—since it’s still relatively new compared to, say, inhaled steroids, I just don’t have a sense for what five or ten years will look like for these folks.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, trade-offs: more appointments, possible injection anxiety, cost headaches, and a bit of uncertainty about the long-term. But honestly, for patients stuck in a cycle of steroids and hospital visits, most of them are willing to at least try it if we can get access sorted out.\n",
      "Researcher: You mentioned that even a single fewer exacerbation can be meaningful for your patients. What magnitude of effect or improvement—like in exacerbation rate or quality of life—would feel truly 'practice-changing' for you in real-world use of dupilumab?\n",
      "User: It doesn’t take much, honestly. In my clinic, if a patient who was having, say, 3-4 exacerbations a year drops to 1 or even 2, that feels huge. That means fewer courses of prednisone, fewer panicked calls, fewer missed workdays or school events. I think sometimes the numbers in studies—“reduced by X percent”—don’t really capture how much one or two fewer bad episodes can change someone’s year.\n",
      "\n",
      "A concrete example: I have a guy in his late 50s who was in the ER at least twice a winter, every winter, plus a handful of steroid tapers from urgent care. We got him on dupilumab last year, and he made it through the last cold/flu season without a single ED visit. He still needed a short burst of steroids once, but he was able to keep working and honestly, his confidence changed. That feels like a “practice-changing” impact to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quality of life is similar—things like folks telling me they’re not afraid to get groceries or ride the bus anymore. If I have a handful of patients every year who say things like that, or their family members mention they seem less anxious at home, I know it’s working. I don’t need to see everyone hitting perfect ACT scores or their FEV1 miraculously jumping. It’s the day-to-day stuff: fewer disruptions, less fear, and just being able to do normal life things. If a treatment reliably delivers that, it’s a big deal for my practice.\n",
      "Researcher: You mentioned earlier that you track exacerbations and quality of life closely. When you start a patient on a new therapy like dupilumab, what specific measures or markers do you use to monitor their response over time? For example, do you use annualized exacerbation rate, CAT or mMRC scores, spirometry, or something else?\n",
      "User: It’s a mix, and honestly it depends a lot on what’s workable for the patient. I try to keep things concrete—so for most folks, I track how many times they’ve needed steroids or urgent care/ED visits since our last appointment. That’s the number one thing I write in the chart, because it’s so tangible and easy for both of us to recall.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do use spirometry at regular follow-ups, but in our setting, it’s not always practical at every visit—sometimes people miss PFT labs, or we’re seeing them virtually. So I lean pretty heavily on their report of symptoms: “How much are you using your rescue inhaler? Any nights you had to get up because you couldn’t breathe?” I jot down those answers and look for trends.\n",
      "\n",
      "For quality of life, I’ll use the ACT (Asthma Control Test) in asthma, or CAT (COPD Assessment Test) for my COPD folks, though not always as consistently as I wish—sometimes we’re juggling so many issues in a 20-minute slot that it gets skipped. If I notice someone’s answers changing, or they mention stuff like going out more, taking care of grandkids, traveling, I make a note.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess my main “score” is really a combination: fewer exacerbations, feeling more confident, and not letting their disease plan their whole life. If those things are moving in the right direction, I consider the treatment a win.\n",
      "Researcher: That's a practical approach. Over what timeframes do you typically assess these markers—do you have a standard schedule, like checking at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, or does it vary based on the patient?\n",
      "User: There’s not really a one-size-fits-all schedule, at least not with my patient mix. For someone starting something new—say, a biologic—I’ll usually see them back at 1 month, then 3 months, then stretch to every 3-6 months if things are stable. But that can shift a lot. Some folks really need closer touchpoints, especially in the first season we try a new therapy, just to troubleshoot and keep them engaged.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lot depends on what else is going on: if they’ve got a history of missing appointments, or social issues that get in the way, sometimes I’ll try to sync their visit with other specialists or even do a quick check-in phone call. Virtual visits have helped a bit for that, but not everyone has the tech or feels comfortable with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spirometry—I try for every 6-12 months if possible, but honestly, it slips for people who can’t get to the lab reliably. CAT or ACT, I’ll aim for each visit, but sometimes it’s just a quick verbal check if we’re squeezed for time.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, it’s more “meet them where they are” than a set protocol. I want data, but I’d rather have imperfect info than lose someone to follow-up because it’s too rigid.\n",
      "Researcher: If a patient is doing well on dupilumab—meaning their exacerbations are down and symptoms are controlled—would you consider de-escalating their inhaled therapy, such as reducing ICS dose or stepping down from triple to dual therapy? If so, how would you approach that?\n",
      "User: Yeah, I have thought about stepping down inhaled meds if someone’s been stable on dupilumab, but to be honest, it’s a slow and pretty cautious process for me. Most of my patients have been on high-dose ICS/LABA for ages, and a lot of them are understandably nervous about change if they’ve finally gotten things under control.\n",
      "\n",
      "If someone’s had zero exacerbations for at least 6 months, no oral steroids, and their ACT is consistently good, I’ll bring up the idea. I usually start by talking through what “stepping down” actually means and why we’d consider it—less risk of side effects, fewer meds to manage. Sometimes folks are eager; usually they’re a bit wary.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of how, I’ll drop the ICS dose first, not the LABA. I don’t usually go straight from triple to dual—I might reduce the ICS, check back in 2-3 months, and see how they’re feeling/sounding. If we’re still solid, then maybe talk about dropping the LAMA or going from triple to dual. All the while, I’m tracking symptoms, ACT scores, and rescue inhaler use pretty closely. And I make it clear: if anything worsens, we bump the dose right back up—no shame, no failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "One challenge is patients’ insurance—sometimes, the triple inhaler is cheaper or easier to get than the dual, which is just ridiculous, but I’ve run into it enough that I always check before writing new scripts. And, for some, the biggest win is just dropping oral steroids or not needing the nebulizer; they don’t care about how many inhalers as long as they feel decent.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, yeah, I’ll step down, but it’s always a joint call with the patient, and not something I rush.\n",
      "Researcher: That's a thoughtful, patient-centered approach. When you do step down therapy or make changes, what kind of documentation do you capture to show value—whether that's for patients, payers, or your group?\n",
      "User: Mostly, I’m documenting symptoms and exacerbation history at every visit—number of steroid bursts, any urgent care or ER visits, ACT scores, and patient-reported outcomes like quality of life or how breathing affects their daily routine. If we’re stepping down, I’ll note why (stable asthma, no exacerbations, patient preference, side effects, etc.) and our plan for follow-up.\n",
      "\n",
      "I try to be very explicit in the note: “Reduced ICS dose due to 9 months stability on dupilumab; will recheck ACT score and rescue usage in 2 months.” That way, if anyone audits the chart—insurance, hospital admin, whoever—it’s clear we’re not being cavalier but are making decisions based on stability and guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes our system flags asthma/COPD control as a quality metric, so I’ll make sure those scores are updated for the population health folks. For payers, there’s still a lot of “prove they still need this expensive drug,” so if anything, I’m probably over-documenting symptoms, adherence, and why we’re continuing or adjusting therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, a lot of the value is in the patient’s own words: “I can walk to church again,” or “I haven’t missed work this season.” I try to get those details in the note too, because they tell the real story.\n",
      "Researcher: Thanks for sharing those details about documentation and value. Shifting gears a bit, could you walk me through the access process in your setting for dupilumab—specifically, what steps are involved with prior authorization, step therapy, and documentation?\n",
      "User: Sure, it’s rarely a quick process for us. Dupilumab almost always needs a prior auth—sometimes even before the first dose. It starts with me submitting chart notes and a letter of medical necessity, which I mostly template at this point: past exacerbations, high-dose ICS/LABA tried, LAMA trial if possible, still uncontrolled, etc. I also throw in spirometry and ACT scores if I have them handy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our pharmacy team helps a ton with the paperwork, but it’s still back-and-forth. The insurers usually want evidence of at least two controller meds, proof of adherence (which is honestly a guess—unless the pharmacy records show refills), and documentation of failed therapies. Some plans get really picky about “step therapy,” so I’ll have to show they’ve tried and failed (or couldn’t tolerate) things like montelukast or even theophylline, which I haven’t prescribed in years.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Medicaid patients, it’s a toss-up. Some get approved in days, others are denied for what feels like arbitrary reasons—wrong ICD code, missing signature, whatever. Appeals take another few weeks, usually with more paperwork or a peer-to-peer call. In the meantime, I’ll sometimes bridge with a sample if I can get one, but those aren’t always available.\n",
      "\n",
      "All told, from first discussion to actually getting dupilumab in the patient’s hands, it can be anywhere from two weeks (best case) to three months (more common). It can be pretty frustrating for both patients and me—especially if someone’s already had multiple exacerbations and is eager to try something new.\n",
      "Researcher: Thanks for explaining your process. You mentioned writing letters of medical necessity—are there certain elements or phrases that you’ve found make a difference in getting approvals, or things payers seem to focus on?\n",
      "User: Honestly, yes—I’ve learned to use certain “magic words” over time. If I just say “uncontrolled asthma,” it’s not enough. I have to be explicit: “Despite documented adherence to high-dose ICS/LABA and LAMA, patient continues to have ≥2 exacerbations per year requiring systemic steroids and/or ER visits.” I always include those numbers—how many bursts, urgent care trips, nights in the hospital. \n",
      "\n",
      "A big one is showing “objective evidence of airflow limitation,” so I reference spirometry (even if it’s a bit outdated, I still cite the last FEV1). For some plans, especially commercial ones, they want to see “failed step therapy with montelukast or theophylline”—I make it clear why those weren’t appropriate or were tried and stopped for side effects. I literally write things like: “Patient unable to tolerate montelukast due to mood changes” or “History of palpitations with theophylline.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I also throw in quality-of-life stuff—missed work, trouble with daily activities—because it personalizes the request. For Medicaid, I’ve noticed they’re very particular about ICD-10 codes matching exactly to their criteria (like J45.50 for severe asthma). If I mess that up, it’s an instant denial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, I write these letters like they’re going to be read by someone who’s never met the patient and needs to check every box before saying yes. It’s tedious, but the more specific and formulaic I am, the more likely it gets approved on the first try.\n",
      "Researcher: That's really helpful to know. How do you see variability across different payers—like Medicare Advantage versus commercial plans—in terms of approval timelines, denials, or the need for appeals?\n",
      "User: Definitely see a lot of variability. Commercial plans are usually the most unpredictable for us—they’ll sometimes approve in a week if everything’s lined up, but other times they’ll bounce it back for the smallest missing detail and make us jump through extra hoops. Some want step therapy documentation all the way back to meds nobody uses anymore, so I’m digging through years-old notes if I can find them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Medicare Advantage tends to be a little more formulaic. If you give them the right codes and the patient history, approvals are often faster—maybe two weeks, sometimes less, though I’ve had occasional oddball denials over technicalities like “evidence of adherence” or missing spirometry. Traditional Medicare, at least in Nebraska, is ironically the simplest—usually no prior auth at all for biologics, so once we order, the pharmacy can fill it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Medicaid’s a mixed bag. Some plans are relatively quick, but others are notorious for bouncing anything that isn’t perfect—wrong code, signature, missing one line in the note. Appeals with Medicaid are slow and can stretch into months if they deny, so if I anticipate a problem, I’ll sometimes try to proactively get all the backup material lined up or even call ahead if I know the right case manager.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of denials and appeals, I spend more time pushing back with commercial and Medicaid plans. Medicare Advantage denials are less common but do happen, usually over missing documentation rather than clinical disagreement. All in all, there’s a lot of variability, and honestly, sometimes I’m just crossing my fingers after submitting because there’s no real transparency on their side.\n",
      "Researcher: You mentioned specialty pharmacy involvement—can you walk me through how dupilumab is dispensed in your setting? For example, is it typically through specialty pharmacy, buy-and-bill, or another channel? How do you coordinate shipping, storage, and refills for your patients?\n",
      "User: For us, it’s almost always through specialty pharmacy. Once we get the prior auth, our clinic sends the prescription to the patient’s insurance-mandated specialty pharmacy—sometimes Accredo, sometimes CVS, sometimes a local option if it’s Medicaid. Rarely, we do buy-and-bill, and that’s basically just for in-hospital use, not outpatients.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coordinating shipping is a whole extra hassle, especially with our patients who move a lot or have unreliable housing. The specialty pharmacy calls the patient to confirm their address and delivery date, but honestly, a decent chunk of my patients don’t answer unknown numbers, so there’s a lot of phone tag. Sometimes, meds get shipped to an old address or held up because they couldn’t reach the patient. In a few cases, we’ve had to reroute the medication to our clinic refrigerator and have the patient pick it up directly, but that’s not ideal—lots of them have transportation issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Storage at home is another pain point. I have to walk through it every time: “Keep it in the fridge, don’t let it freeze, but don’t inject it cold.” Not everyone has a reliable fridge, and in summer, power outages can be a real problem. Refills are coordinated by the specialty pharmacy, but I often have to submit updated clinic notes or confirm ongoing need every few months. If the pharmacy can’t reach the patient for refill confirmation, things can stall out for weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s also a chunk of my time spent just troubleshooting—tracking down where the med is, helping the patient call the pharmacy, sometimes faxing the same paperwork two or three times when it “gets lost.” It’s a running joke in our clinic that getting the drug to the patient is half the battle.\n",
      "Researcher: You mentioned that cost and copay can be major barriers. How do you and your team help patients navigate financial assistance or foundation support for dupilumab, and what kinds of conversations do you have with patients about out-of-pocket costs?\n",
      "User: Yeah, cost is a huge sticking point—probably the number one reason patients end up not starting or stopping dupilumab. For commercially insured patients, we pretty much always try to get them onto the manufacturer’s copay card, but not everyone qualifies—if they have Medicare or Medicaid, that’s a no-go, and even with commercial plans, sometimes the card only covers so much, and the patient’s still looking at hundreds a month.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have a nurse navigator who’s great at this, but even so, it’s a lot of back-and-forth—submitting applications, making copies of insurance cards, explaining income reporting. Some patients just get overwhelmed by all the paperwork and give up. I spend a lot of time upfront setting expectations with patients: “There may be a delay, and you might get sticker shock from the first bill, but call us before you do anything.” I’ve even had a few patients who got a $3500 bill, panicked, and just stopped answering calls until we sorted it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Medicaid, it’s less about copay and more about making sure the prior auth is perfect so they don’t get billed at all. With Medicare, if there’s a Part D plan involved, we’ll sometimes try to connect them with a foundation or extra help program, but funding gets snapped up fast—if it’s not January or February, odds aren’t great.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes I have to be super blunt in the exam room. I’ll say, “This medication is expensive, and the insurance coverage is tricky. Are you comfortable if we try, knowing there may be some hoops to jump through?” It’s not uncommon for patients to decide it’s not worth the hassle—or for me to recommend alternatives if I know the financial lift will be too much. \n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, it’s a team effort, but I’d say for every patient who actually gets on dupilumab and stays on it, there are probably two or three where the process falls apart somewhere between insurance, cost, and logistics.\n",
      "Researcher: Thanks for walking through the access and financial navigation side. Shifting to workflow, how does your team coordinate the practical aspects of starting and monitoring a patient on dupilumab? For example, who handles education, training on self-injection, tracking labs, and monitoring response?\n",
      "User: It’s a patchwork, honestly. The initial education piece usually starts with me during the visit—I’ll go over why we’re thinking about dupilumab, what to expect, and basic side effects. Then, our nurse navigator or one of our RNs takes over the “how-to” training. They’ll either do it in-person, showing the device and walking through an injection with a demo pen, or sometimes over video if the patient can’t make it back in. \n",
      "\n",
      "We used to rely on the drug reps for injection teaching, but COVID changed that—now it’s mostly on us. The specialty pharmacy will sometimes do a follow-up call, but not always, and sometimes it’s just confusing for the patient to get info from multiple sources. \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of labs, honestly, we’re not tracking anything specific just for dupilumab once they’re on it—there isn’t a big lab monitoring requirement. If the patient has underlying liver or eosinophil issues, I’ll check those every so often, but it’s not protocolized. Mostly, it’s symptom response: Are they using less rescue inhaler? Fewer exacerbations? That’s tracked at routine follow-ups, usually at 1 month, 3 months, then every 3-6 months if things are stable. \n",
      "\n",
      "If the patient misses a dose, they usually call the clinic in a panic, and my nurse tries to walk them through next steps. As for tracking, it’s all notes in Epic—we don’t have a fancy registry. I set myself reminders for follow-up calls or visits, but if a patient falls off the radar, it’s easy to lose track unless they reach out to us. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, there’s no single “dupilumab coordinator.” It’s whoever’s available that day, plus a lot of teamwork and, honestly, hoping patients feel comfortable enough to call if they run into trouble.\n",
      "Researcher: That's a great overview of your team's workflow. When it comes to training patients on self-injection, what kinds of device preferences or training needs have you encountered—do patients tend to prefer the pen or syringe, and do you ever require first-dose observation in clinic versus starting at home?\n",
      "User: Device preference really depends on the patient. Older folks or those with dexterity issues usually prefer the pen—they like that it’s one click and done, less fussing with needles. I had a younger patient last month, early 20s, who was honestly kind of squeamish and wanted the auto-injector for that reason. But I’ve also had a couple of folks, especially people with prior experience on injectables (like diabetics), who prefer the syringe because they feel more in control. I let them choose when possible, but sometimes the pharmacy only has one option, and we just go with what’s available.\n",
      "\n",
      "First-dose observation—I don’t routinely do that for dupilumab. Unless there’s a big concern about allergies or the patient is super anxious, most people are okay to do it at home after we walk them through it in clinic or by video. If someone’s really nervous, our nurse will bring them back for their first injection, but that’s the exception, not the rule. I think we did more of the supervised first dose early on, but now that it’s more common, we’re comfortable letting people start at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Biggest training need is just reassurance—people get really anxious about doing the injection wrong. Lots of “What if I mess up?” or “What if I hit a vein?” So we spend a lot of time just normalizing it, showing them the demo, and emphasizing there’s a learning curve. Sometimes we’ll have patients or caregivers record the teaching on their phone so they can review later—works well for people who are visual learners or forget things once they walk out.\n",
      "Researcher: You mentioned some of your patients have transportation or access challenges. For those in rural or community settings, what specific barriers do you encounter when coordinating labs, injections, or follow-up for biologics like dupilumab?\n",
      "User: It’s definitely tougher for patients who live outside Omaha or don’t have reliable transportation. For labs, if it’s something routine, I can usually send orders to their local lab, but for injection teaching or follow-up, that gets tricky. Some of our patients have to take two buses just to get here, so coming in just for teaching isn’t realistic. We try to do as much as possible via video, but that only works if they have good internet and a device—which isn’t always the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes we coordinate with their primary clinic if they’re plugged into a community health center. I’ll send over instructions or have our nurse talk with their team, but there’s a lot of phone tag, and not every clinic is comfortable giving biologics. I had a patient from Grand Island who ended up delaying her start for three weeks because the local pharmacy couldn’t get the med and she didn’t have a way to pick it up from us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Follow-up’s another headache—patients might miss visits because of work, weather, or just because it’s too much hassle. If they drop off, sometimes we don’t hear until we see a new hospitalization note in Epic. We’re trying to partner more with community pharmacies and telehealth, but that’s still a work in progress. It’s a patchwork, and honestly, a lot of the follow-up is just us improvising—calling, texting, whatever works for that patient.\n",
      "Researcher: You mentioned using Epic and some custom smartphrases, but not having a standardized EHR workflow for biologics. If you could design a best-in-class EHR playbook or order set for starting and monitoring dupilumab in COPD, what features or tools would you want to include?\n",
      "User: Oh, I could go on about this—right now, it’s a lot of cobbling together pieces from asthma or allergy protocols, and tracking everything with our own checklists or sticky notes. If I could build something from scratch for dupilumab in COPD, here’s what would actually help us in the trenches:\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, a standardized order set that bundles all the baseline labs (CBC, maybe hepatitis panel, whatever’s relevant for current guidelines), plus a prompt for immunizations if they’re overdue. It would be great if it could nudge us with the actual recs—\"Patient last had flu vaccine in 2021\"—instead of making us dig through the chart.\n",
      "\n",
      "The teaching piece is always a pain point, so a structured documentation template would make a huge difference. Something that guides the nurse or provider through what needs to be covered—who’s giving the first dose, is the patient anxious, did you demo, do they have caregiver support, is a video link sent—all that. And a space for us to drop in the patient’s preferred language or any health literacy needs so we’re not reinventing the wheel every time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Follow-up reminders are key. Half the time, we lose track of who’s overdue for a dose or whose next injection falls on a holiday. It would be awesome if the EHR could flag missed doses, send a MyChart reminder, or just prompt us during the visit—\"Patient due for dupilumab, confirm refill and adherence.\" Bonus points if it could link up with our pharmacy so we know if meds are actually picked up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, easy access to patient-facing resources. Right now, we’re hunting around for printables or reliable videos. If there was a tab or button in the order set with language-appropriate handouts and demo videos, that would save a ton of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Big picture, it needs to be flexible for real-world hiccups: lets us document barriers like insurance delays or pharmacy shortages, and tracks patient-specific adaptations (like if we handed off training to a community nurse). Otherwise, we’re just playing catch-up and hoping nothing slips through the cracks.\n",
      "Researcher: Thanks for sharing your EHR wishlist. Thinking about your team, who typically takes the lead on coordinating across all these steps—education, pharmacy communication, follow-up reminders—for patients starting on dupilumab?\n",
      "User: It really depends on the week, honestly. Ideally, our nurse navigator would quarterback the whole thing, but she’s stretched pretty thin—she covers asthma, COPD, some ILD, so there’s a lot on her plate. Sometimes I’ll do the initial education myself if the patient’s here for their consult, especially if there are language or health literacy concerns. But for the nitty-gritty logistics, like chasing down the specialty pharmacy or making sure insurance approvals are moving, it usually falls to our clinic nurse or our MA, depending on who’s available.\n",
      "\n",
      "We don’t have a formal “biologics coordinator” like some big centers. It’s a patchwork: whoever picks up the Epic message or phone call first. There’s quite a bit of back-and-forth between me, the nurse, our pharmacy tech, and sometimes even the social worker if there’s a transportation or financial barrier. On a busy clinic day, things can fall through the cracks, especially when we’re juggling inpatient and outpatient stuff. I’d say communication is our biggest pain point—sometimes the patient gets three calls from three different people, sometimes no one calls at all. We try to huddle at the end of clinic, but it’s not as seamless as I’d like.\n",
      "Researcher: You mentioned earlier that missed doses or follow-up can be a challenge for some patients. What strategies or tools have you found most effective for helping patients stay on track with their dupilumab injections and appointments?\n",
      "User: A couple things have actually worked, though none are perfect. For some of my patients, especially the ones who use their phones a lot, setting up calendar reminders during their visit is helpful. I’ll sit with them—sometimes with their adult child or spouse there—and we’ll plug in the injection schedule right into their phone calendar, with a little alert a day before. That works better than just handing them a paper, in my experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our system has MyChart, and I try to enroll everyone, but honestly, a lot of my older patients or those with limited English either don’t have access or don’t check it. For them, I write the next appointment and injection date in big letters on a card and give it to them (with pictograms if needed). Occasionally, our MA will call to remind them, but with our volume, that’s not reliable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve had a few patients where I loop in a caregiver or a home health nurse—sometimes the only way the patient actually gets their shot on time. In some cases, social work gets involved, especially if transportation is an issue. It’s not a streamlined system—it’s a lot of workarounds, and sometimes we still miss a dose, especially if there’s trouble with insurance approvals or a pharmacy delay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line: high-tech reminders help some, but I still rely heavily on low-tech fixes and personal connections to actually get things done, especially for our more vulnerable patients.\n",
      "Researcher: Thinking about education, what are the biggest knowledge gaps or uncertainties you see among your colleagues, staff, or patients when it comes to identifying and managing eosinophilic COPD—especially now that biologics like dupilumab are entering the picture?\n",
      "User: Honestly, eosinophilic COPD is still pretty fuzzy for a lot of people, myself included sometimes. My attendings back in residency hammered home eosinophils for asthma, but in COPD it was always more of a side note. Even now, if I bring up “eosinophilic phenotype” with my internal medicine colleagues or even some of my newer fellows, I get a lot of blank stares or people defaulting to, “Isn’t that just asthma?” There’s a lot of overlap and confusion on when it really matters. \n",
      "\n",
      "Just last month—I think it was around May 10th—I had a 72-year-old former smoker admitted with a COPD exacerbation. His eos was 310, but nobody flagged it until I rounded, and pharmacy actually called me about it because they were reviewing eligibility for some new protocols. The team had ordered steroids as usual, but there wasn’t really a conversation about what to do long-term or whether it changed his management. I had to pull up the latest GOLD recs and honestly, the guidance is pretty vague. People know it *might* affect inhaler choice or steroid use, but the “so what” is not clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for dupilumab, I’d say almost none of our front desk staff or even some nurses know what it is unless they’ve worked in allergy or rheum before. Some think it’s like another inhaler, and patients definitely don’t know—most have never heard of “eosinophilic” anything unless I explain it with pictures or really basic language. I try to keep it simple, like, “You have a certain type of inflammation we can check on your blood tests, and there are new treatments for that.” But honestly, it’s still a steep learning curve for all of us. \n",
      "\n",
      "A big gap is what to do if the eos is borderline, or fluctuates—our lab spits out wildly different numbers depending on whether they’re on or off steroids, and there’s no perfect cutoff. That uncertainty makes it harder to feel confident about starting a biologic or explaining the reasoning to anyone else on the team.\n",
      "Researcher: That's a really helpful summary of the knowledge gaps. Thinking about education for clinicians specifically, what kinds of resources or formats would be most useful for you and your colleagues to feel more confident in identifying and managing eosinophilic COPD—like quick-reference algorithms, case examples, webinars, or something else?\n",
      "User: For us, honestly, the shorter and more practical, the better. We don’t have time for another hour-long webinar during clinic, and honestly, most people won’t watch them unless it’s required CME or there’s free lunch. What actually gets used in our group are things like laminated pocket cards with a stepwise approach or a visual algorithm taped up in the workroom—something you can glance at on rounds and quickly jog your memory. Case examples are helpful, especially if they’re short and tie back to real-life situations we see—like, “Here’s a patient with eos 250 on chronic steroids, what now?” Or, “What do you do if the insurance denies the biologic?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the newer guidelines have online flowcharts, but they’re dense—if someone made a 1-page summary with just the thresholds, what to check before starting a biologic, and major do’s/don’ts, I’d print that out for the fellows and put it in our team room. Also, having a couple of real patient stories with pitfalls and outcomes—kind of like M&M but focused on decision-making with eosinophils—would actually stick with people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, integrating prompts into the EMR helps too. We saw this after the last Epic update; the asthma order sets now flag high eos, so something similar for COPD would at least remind folks to consider phenotypes. But high-yield, visual, and easily accessible—those are key. Otherwise, it just becomes another unread email.\n",
      "Researcher: That's great feedback on clinician education. Shifting to patient education, what information or tools do you find most important to help your COPD patients understand what to expect from a biologic like dupilumab—such as onset of effect, injection comfort, side effects, or when to call the clinic?\n",
      "User: With patient education, I always start with the basics: why are we even talking about another shot when they already take so many meds? I use visual aids—usually a drawing or a chart showing how “regular” COPD inflammation is different from the kind you see with high eosinophils. Most folks honestly don’t care about the cellular details, but if I say, “We found a marker in your blood that means you might do better with this new medicine,” that gets attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most important things for them are: “Will I notice a difference and when?” “Is this going to hurt?” “What side effects should I worry about?” And, “How much of a hassle is it?” Comfort with self-injection is a big barrier—most of my older patients have never done it and are nervous. We rely on our nurses to do a demo and watch the first injection, and I’ll sometimes pull up a YouTube video if they’re visual learners.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cost and insurance are always questions. Half the time, I can’t answer those off the bat, so I warn them it may take weeks to get approval. Side effect-wise, I keep it simple: “Most people tolerate it well, but call us if you get a rash, fever, or swelling.” \n",
      "\n",
      "I try to give them a handout with pictures and keep the instructions to one page. Our health literacy rates vary a ton, so I avoid medical jargon and underline when they should call us or go to the ER. \n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, the biggest hurdle is making sure they know who to contact if something goes wrong—patients get lost in the system, so we put our nurse navigator’s direct number on every education sheet. That makes a big difference.\n",
      "Researcher: You mentioned earlier that resource limitations and workflow challenges can make it tough to implement new therapies, especially outside of academic centers. What kinds of tools, support, or changes would most help reduce hesitation or make it easier for clinicians in community or resource-limited settings to adopt dupilumab for COPD?\n",
      "User: Honestly, the biggest challenges I hear from colleagues in community clinics or smaller hospitals are around logistics and follow-up. There’s no pharmacist walking the halls or an embedded nurse navigator—they’re juggling everything themselves. So, any tool that saves time or takes the guesswork out is huge. \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, a one-page checklist that spells out: 1) what labs to check before starting, 2) a script for insurance prior auth (with common ICD-10 codes, sample language, etc.), and 3) a quick symptom tracker for patients. That’s way more valuable than a 10-page guideline or a slick PDF buried in an intranet folder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, automatic EMR prompts do help a lot. Not everyone has Epic, but even a simple template in the chart—“Eos >300? Consider [drug name]. Next steps: A, B, C”—would get people thinking about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "If there was a central hotline—like a manufacturer nurse educator or a regional rep—where community docs could call for help with insurance denials or dosing questions, that would lower the threshold to try. Most don’t have time (or staff) to chase down prior auth for weeks, so anything that smooths that process helps. \n",
      "\n",
      "For follow-up, something as basic as a script for the first refill call, or a template for when to bring patients back, would standardize things. Otherwise, it gets lost in the shuffle—especially if there’s high staff turnover or the clinician is only there a day or two a week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line: practical, simple, and embedded into existing workflows—otherwise, it doesn’t get used.\n",
