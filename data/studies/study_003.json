    "study_name": "From Hospital to Home Ventilation: Pulmonologists’ Interpretation and Implementation of CMS’s 2025 NCD for COPD Chronic Respiratory Failure",
    "study_summary": "This study explores how pulmonologists will translate CMS’s new national coverage determination for home noninvasive ventilation into everyday decisions. It uncovers discharge‑to‑home pathways, device selection (RAD vs HMV), documentation practices, and collaboration with DMEs and pulmonary rehabilitation. It highlights setting‑specific barriers and enablers across academic/community and rural/urban contexts to inform education and support services.",
    "research_motivation": "In June 2025, CMS finalized a national coverage determination establishing Medicare coverage criteria for home noninvasive ventilation (including respiratory assist devices with backup and home mechanical ventilators) for chronic respiratory failure due to COPD, replacing patchwork local policies and specifying qualifying criteria and follow‑up expectations. citeturn5search1turn5search3turn5search7 This policy change materially affects hospital discharge planning and outpatient COPD management by standardizing access to RADs/HMVs nationwide. citeturn5search0",
    "research_directive": "Center the conversation on clinicians’ awareness and understanding of the NCD and how it changes their care pathways: definitions of “the right patient at the right time,” clinical triggers for escalation (e.g., persistent hypercapnia despite optimal medical therapy), and how thresholds and documentation will be applied in real cases. Map the discharge‑to‑home workflow (team roles, testing, education, care plan sign‑off), device selection logic (RAD vs HMV; backup rate considerations), and integration with oxygen therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation across different settings (academic vs community; rural vs urban). \n\nProbe operational pain points (DME/supplier capacity, training and adherence monitoring, data access and telemonitoring, readmission risk management), payer interpretations (practical documentation checklists, recertification cadence), and patient/caregiver readiness (burden, safety concerns, home environment). Identify what clinical outcomes and real‑world evidence would signal success and confidence (adherence, exacerbation‑related utilization, symptom/function measures) and what enablement assets are most needed (checklists, order sets, discharge toolkits, device‑agnostic troubleshooting). Contrast how larger academic centers vs smaller community practices will operationalize the policy and what support is required to avoid rural access inequities.",

        "intro": "Welcome, purpose: We’re exploring how you interpret and plan to operationalize CMS’s 2025 national coverage determination (NCD) for home NIV (RADs with backup and HMVs) in COPD chronic respiratory failure.\nConfidentiality: No attribution; aggregate reporting only. There are no right/wrong answers—interested in your experience and perspective.\nFlow: We’ll start with your awareness/interpretation, then walk through patient identification, discharge‑to‑home workflow, device selection, operations/payers, and close on outcomes and support needs.\nWarm‑up: In a sentence or two, describe your current approach to identifying and managing COPD patients with chronic respiratory failure in your practice.",
