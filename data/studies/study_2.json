    "study_name": "Nebulized Novelty: Positioning Ensifentrine (Ohtuvayre™) Amid Triple Therapy, Device Burden, and Rural Access",
    "study_summary": "This study explores how pulmonologists position ensifentrine (Ohtuvayre™), the first novel COPD maintenance therapy in over 20 years, relative to dual therapy, triple therapy, and biologic add-ons. It investigates which patient subgroups benefit most from a nebulized dual-mechanism option, how clinicians weigh dosing time against device challenges, and what real-world heuristics they use for sequencing, titration, and combining therapies. The research also probes operational and equity barriers—such as nebulizer access, caregiver roles, and rural disparities—while capturing expectations for Merck’s acquisition-driven scale-up and the evidence pulmonologists want to support future adoption.",
    "research_motivation": "Ensifentrine (Ohtuvayre) won FDA approval in June 2024 as the first inhaled COPD maintenance therapy with a novel MOA in >20 years (dual PDE3/4), delivered twice daily via a standard jet nebulizer (≈5–7 minutes). In 2025, FDA snapshots and HCP materials reinforced dosing and device specifics; concurrently, real-world and pipeline work around triple therapy (e.g., Breztri) continues. In July 2025, AP reported Merck’s $10B acquisition plan for Verona, signaling scale-up and competitive shifts.",
    "research_directive": "Elicit how pulmonologists segment COPD candidates for ensifentrine versus (a) optimizing LAMA/LABA, (b) stepping to triple therapy, or (c) moving toward biologic add-ons. Drill into the perceived job-to-be-done for a nebulized, dual-mechanism bronchodilator/anti-inflammatory: Who benefits most (technique limitations, frailty, low inspiratory flow, poly-device fatigue)? What are clinicians’ device-time thresholds, and how do they weigh 5–7 minutes BID against inhaler coordination challenges? Capture specific titration/sequence heuristics and how they reconcile lung-function improvements (FEV1 AUC) with patient-salient outcomes (dyspnea, rescue use, exacerbations). Document beliefs about combining ensifentrine with other maintenance agents and any “real-world” workarounds (without mixing in nebulizer cup per label).  Probe operational and equity lenses: nebulizer availability, compressor reliability, DME logistics, and caregiver roles—especially in rural settings or low-resource communities. Contrast academic vs community comfort with prescribing and follow-up cadence; identify failure points (non-persistence, device cleaning, infection concerns). Explore how ATS/GOLD discourse and cardiopulmonary comorbidity framing influence adoption versus triple therapy. End with market-structure perceptions post-Merck deal: expectations for access programs, education, and evidence gaps pulmonologists want (exacerbation endpoints, subpopulation cuts, cardiopulmonary outcomes).",
