    "study_name": "Nebulized Maintenance Reimagined: Pulmonologists’ Positioning of Ensifentrine (Ohtuvayre) in COPD Care Paths",
    "study_summary": "This study examines how clinicians position ensifentrine, the first‑in‑class dual PDE3/4 inhibitor, within maintenance therapy. It explores which patient types benefit most (e.g., poor inhaler technique, low inspiratory flow, persistent dyspnea) and how device preferences, logistics, and payer rules shape use. It also identifies message elements needed to differentiate ensifentrine from existing bronchodilators and from prior experiences with PDE4 inhibitors.",
    "research_motivation": "The FDA approved ensifentrine (Ohtuvayre) on June 26, 2024, as a nebulized maintenance treatment for COPD, supported by Phase 3 ENHANCE data; the approval introduced a novel, dual PDE3/4 mechanism with bronchodilator and non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory effects. citeturn1search2turn1news13 GOLD 2025 subsequently added ensifentrine to maintenance options and follow‑up algorithms, providing guidance on add‑on use for symptomatic patients despite dual bronchodilation. citeturn2search2turn2search3",
    "research_directive": "Direct the discussion to understand where ensifentrine fits relative to LABA/LAMA and triple therapy in real practice: triggers for adding a nebulized maintenance agent (persistent dyspnea, frequent SABA use, suboptimal inhaler technique, low inspiratory flow), expectations of symptom relief vs exacerbation impact, and how clinicians will sequence or combine therapies. Explore beliefs, past experiences, and skepticism related to PDE4 mechanisms (e.g., comparisons to roflumilast tolerability), and clarify how the nebulized route reframes patient selection—particularly among older adults, those with cognitive/arthritis limitations, and rural patients with limited training resources.\n\nProbe device and logistics mindsets: home nebulizer access, set‑up and maintenance burdens, teaching workflows, and coordination with DMEs; adherence perceptions for nebulization versus handheld inhalers; and anticipated payer realities (coverage, prior auth criteria, step‑edits with dual bronchodilators). Identify the clinical endpoints that would convince adoption (patient‑reported outcomes, rescue use, clinic‑observed FEV1 changes) and the message elements that resonate (dual PDE3/4 MOA made simple, population most similar to their panels, practical “how I use it” stories). Contrast academic vs community norms for evidence thresholds and capture urban vs rural differences in access, DME reliability, and patient coaching capacity.",

No right or wrong answers—please speak from your own practice.\n- Confidentiality assured; we’re recording for note accuracy; we’re interested in your real-world experiences, not textbook answers.\n- We’ll focus on patient types, sequencing decisions, logistics, access, and the kind of evidence and messaging that would (or would not) change behavior.\n\nQuick participant context (one line each)\n- Practice setting (academic vs community), geography (urban/suburban/rural), typical COPD panel size/severity mix, and percent using nebulized therapies today for maintenance vs rescue.",
