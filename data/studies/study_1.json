    "study_name": "After the First COPD Biologic: How Pulmonologists Re-draw the Lines Between Inhalers, Biomarkers, and Type-2 Inflammation",
    "study_summary": "The study examines how U.S. pulmonologists are redefining treatment boundaries after the FDA approval of dupilumab as the first biologic for COPD with type-2 inflammation. It explores how clinicians identify and validate the type-2 phenotype (e.g., eosinophil thresholds, exacerbation history), interpret dupilumab trial results against daily practice realities, and decide when to escalate from inhaled maintenance therapy to a biologic add-on. The research also probes access dynamics, payer hurdles, rural-urban differences, and evidence gaps that could influence future adoption and prescribing confidence.",
    "research_motivation": "In September 2024, dupilumab (Dupixent) became the first biologic approved in the U.S. for COPD (type-2 inflammation phenotype), following earlier EU approval; clinical coverage and education have ramped through 2025, with payer list-price disclosures around ~$3,993/month and mixed real-world access dynamics. GOLD 2025 also sharpened emphasis on comorbidity management and updates to drug classes.",
    "research_directive": "Explore how pulmonologists (academic/non-academic; rural/urban) decide when a COPD patient “graduates” from inhaled maintenance to add-on biologic therapy. Map their mental model of type-2 inflammation in COPD: how they define the phenotype; which biomarkers (eosinophils, exacerbation history) and cutoffs they trust; how they interpret pivotal dupilumab data (exacerbation reduction, lung-function changes) versus daily clinic realities (polypharmacy, adherence, rehab access). Probe how GOLD 2025 and local ILD/asthma overlap clinics shape eligibility screens, referrals, and shared care (PCP/allergy). Surface the precise inflection points that flip the decision from triple therapy optimization to biologic add-on, and how this differs by practice type and geography. Unpack access choreography: prior auth evidence they assemble, payer variability (Medicare Part D vs commercial), sample pathways, and how list-price optics translate into conversations with patients (out-of-pocket expectations, specialty-pharmacy onboarding, injection training, monitoring). Contrast rural vs urban barriers (lab turnaround, biomarker repeatability, transportation) and academic vs community comfort with immunology-driven COPD narratives. Capture language clinicians use to position biologics alongside or instead of further inhaler intensification, and what “success” looks like at 3/6/12 months (exacerbations, CAT, rescue SABA use, QoL). Identify lingering uncertainties and evidence requests that would change behavior (head-to-head vs optimized triple therapy; sub-group data by eos ranges; long-term safety).",

There are no right answers—please think aloud. We may discuss pivotal data (e.g., dupilumab, GOLD 2025) purely to understand your view; we’re not evaluating your practice."
