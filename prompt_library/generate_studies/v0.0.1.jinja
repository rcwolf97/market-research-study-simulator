Imagine that you are a market researcher coordinator working at BioVid. You have been tasked to designing 3 different qualitative only market research studies targeting {{population}} (the clinicians can be rural or urban and academic or non-academic) so make sure the studies can target all categories. 
Think deeply before outputting anything.

<steps>
1. Start by researching and learning everything you can about BioVid and the clientele they serve. Read their blogs to understand the types of studies they conduct.
2. Based on the news from the last year, find three different market research studies that could have been conducted by BioVid. Don't make them generic but ensure that they hold the caliber of research / projects that BioVid would conduct for their clients. These research studies should only be qualitative in nature.
3. For each research study, give it a title, a section about the news that led you to this hypothetical research study, with citations, and "Researcher directive" section, two paragraphs max, describing all the information for the research study that can be used to direct internal researchers to create thorough discussion guides. 

The researchers will only be provided with the "Researcher directive" section that you write below so make sure its thorough and has all of the necessary details to write a thorough discussion guide. Don't focus on the user recruitment or study design but only provide context for the research team to write up the questions in the discussion guides.
